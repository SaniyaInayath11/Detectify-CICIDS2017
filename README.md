# CICIDS 2017 Repository

## üìä Overview
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks crafted to analyze the **CICIDS 2017** dataset‚Äîone of the most comprehensive datasets for intrusion detection system (IDS) research. The notebooks guide you through end-to-end workflows including data exploration, preprocessing, and training of machine learning models.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Dataset Download**: Easily retrieves the CICIDS 2017 dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes and summarizes key patterns in the data.
- **Model Training**:
  - **Binary Classification**: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine.
  - **Multi-Class Classification**: K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
  - **Deep Learning Models**: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), applied to both binary and multi-class tasks.

## üß∞ Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the notebooks in your Jupyter environment.
3. Follow the inline instructions to run the code and analyze the results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the Conda Environment

Set up your Conda environment using the following steps:

```bash
# 1. Create a new environment
conda create -n cicids python=3.9

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate cicids

# 3. Install core dependencies
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow

# 4. Install additional tools
pip install missingno imbalanced-learn wget

# 5. Install Jupyter Notebook
pip install jupyter notebook

# 6. Set up the IPython kernel for Jupyter
pip install ipykernel

# 7. Register the environment with Jupyter
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=cicids
```

## üì¶ Requirements
Ensure the following Python packages are installed:

- `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- `missingno`, `imbalanced-learn`, `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (or `keras` for deep learning models)
- `wget` for dataset downloads

## üìÇ Dataset Details

The CICIDS 2017 dataset is available in three formats:
- Raw network traffic (PCAPs)
- Labeled NetFlow data
- Machine Learning-ready CSV files

In this project, we use the **MachineLearningCSV.zip** version. During download, the file is renamed to **MachineLearningCVE.zip** to match the filename required by the `MachineLearningCSV.md5` checksum.

You can find more information at the [CICIDS 2017 official dataset page](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html).
